What accounts for this discrepancy? We proposed that cues’ content critically determines their effectiveness and sought to select the right cues by building a computational model of how cues affect memory search. Participants (N = 195 young adults from the United States) recalled significantly more items when receiving our model’s best (vs. worst) cue. Our model provides an account of why some cues better aid recall: Effective cues activate contexts most similar to the remaining items’ contexts, facilitating recall in an unsearched area of memory. We discuss our contributions in relation to prominent theories about the effect of external cues.","School of Engineering and Applied Science","United States",0,4,"In-Progress","all",489,4560,9.3,86,3200,16,92,NA,NA,NA,"Psychological Science","SAGE Publications Inc.",1990,2024,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,"RESULTS__Effectiveness of Model-Based Cue Selection_13","downloads/Psychological_Science/10117709567976231215298.grobid.tei.xml","p = .003","p = .003","exact",0.003,TRUE,NA,0.003

Despite its significance, notable gaps impede a full understanding of how loneliness changes across the adult life span and what factors influence these changes. To address this, we conducted a coordinated data analysis of nine longitudinal studies encompassing 128,118 participants ages 13 to 103 from over 20 countries. Using harmonized variables and models, we examined loneliness trajectories and predictors. Analyses revealed that loneliness follows a U-shaped curve, decreasing from young adulthood to midlife and increasing in older adulthood. These patterns were consistent across studies. Several baseline factors (i.e., sex, marital status, physical function, education) were linked to loneliness levels, but few moderated the loneliness trajectories. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of loneliness and underscore the need for targeted interventions to reduce social disparities throughout adulthood.","Stanford University School of Medicine","United States",0,12,"In-Progress","all",489,4560,9.3,86,3200,16,92,NA,NA,NA,"Psychological Science","SAGE Publications Inc.",1990,2024,0,0,0,NA,NA,0,"RESULTS__How does loneliness change with age?_1","downloads/Psychological_Science/10117709567976241242037.grobid.tei.xml","B = 0.07, SE = 0.03, p = .01","p = .01","exact",0.01,TRUE,NA,0.01

We present free-viewing eye-tracking data of 20 healthy adults on a new video dataset of natural scenes, each mapped for its potential for change (PfC) in independent ratings. Observers looking at frozen videos looked significantly more often at the parts of the scene with a high PfC compared with static images, with substantially higher interobserver coherence. This viewing difference peaked right before a potential movement onset. Established concepts like object animacy or salience alone could not explain this finding.
